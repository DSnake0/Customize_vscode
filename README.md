$DESCRIPTION

## üìÇ Repository Contents
- `custom.css`: Custom styles for the VS Code interface.
- `custom.js`: JavaScript for animations and interactivity.
- `settings.json`: Pre-configured settings to enable customization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

### Linux
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone $REPO_LINK
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd Customize_vscode
   ```
3. Copy the `custom.css`, `custom.js`, and `settings.json` files to your VS Code configuration directory:
   ```bash
   cp custom.css custom.js settings.json ~/.config/Code/User/
   ```
4. Restart VS Code and ensure that custom settings are enabled.

### macOS
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone $REPO_LINK
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd Customize_vscode
   ```
3. Copy the `custom.css`, `custom.js`, and `settings.json` files to your VS Code configuration directory:
   ```bash
   cp custom.css custom.js settings.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/
   ```
4. Restart VS Code and ensure that custom settings are enabled.

### Windows
1. Clone the repository:
   ```cmd
   git clone $REPO_LINK
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```cmd
   cd Customize_vscode
   ```
3. Copy the `custom.css`, `custom.js`, and `settings.json` files to your VS Code configuration directory:
   ```cmd
   copy custom.css custom.js settings.json "%APPDATA%\Code\User\"
   ```
4. Restart VS Code and ensure that custom settings are enabled.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. The `custom.css` file applies new styles to your VS Code interface.
2. The `custom.js` file enables animations and interactive elements.
3. The `settings.json` file links the CSS and JS files to VS Code's settings, ensuring seamless integration.

### Example `settings.json` Configuration
```json
{
  "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///path/to/your/custom.css",
    "file:///path/to/your/custom.js"
  ]
}
```
